# broadcast-receiver-exploitation-PoC

The objective of this lab is to demonstrate how to exploit vulnerable broadcast receivers and the exploitation impact. 
For this purpose, there are two Android applications:


### Itamar App

Itamar is the Android application containing the vulnerable receiver component, the target app. 
The application has only a button, which, when pressed, generates an Android system notification with information that cannot be modified.

### KomodoReceiverTest App

KomodoReceiverTest is a malicious Android application targeting the vulnerable receiver component within the Itamar application. 
This app has a text field and a button. When the button is pressed, it transfers the user's input from the text field to the vulnerable receiver component in the Itamar application, then the receiver generates a new Android system notification with the transferred data.
